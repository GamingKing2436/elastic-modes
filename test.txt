Try typing spaces on the next line, noticing where the cursor falls.
 




Example elastic table to play with:

Column A	Column B	Column C
short	cells	first row
a very long cell here		notice the blank cell
mostly-blank row	
another row	which is still in the tabble	b/c the previous line ended in a tab





Relative indentation test:

	start outer block |
	                  | align to bar
	                      start inner block
	                      this block is indented from the bar
	                      the leading space here has tabs followed by spaces followed by tabs
	                      end inner block
	                  |
	end outer block





A code example using both modes.  Yes, elastic-table-mode is basically the same thing as “elastic tabstops”, but notice how you also need elastic-indent-mode to align the broken-up sum.

void exampleFunc(int s, int medium, int verylongargname) {
	printf("sum of numbers: %i", s +	/* the first arg	*/
	                             medium +	/* the second arg	*/
	                             verylongargname);	/* the third arg	*/
